Hello, I’m Nguyễn Đức Huy, a dedicated Fullstack Developer with a deep passion for crafting innovative technological solutions. I’m currently working on an ambitious e-commerce website project inspired by TopZone—a specialized platform focused on selling authentic Apple products. This project is designed to incorporate all the essential features of a modern electronic retail website, including a user-friendly interface, a smart shopping cart, and a secure, streamlined checkout process, all aimed at delivering an exceptional online shopping experience.

The project is built using **ASP.NET Core 8**, leveraging its powerful framework to ensure high performance, scalability, and maintainability. For data management, I’m utilizing **MySQL** integrated with SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), providing a robust and efficient database solution to handle product catalogs, user information, and transaction records seamlessly. This tech stack allows me to create a dynamic and reliable system tailored to the demands of an e-commerce platform.

Beyond the core functionalities, I’m actively enhancing the project by integrating advanced features such as quick login options via Google and Facebook, allowing users to access the platform effortlessly without manual account creation. Additionally, I’m exploring and implementing various APIs to extend the system’s capabilities—think customer data analytics tools, optimized product search functionality, and overall performance improvements. My goal is to transform this into more than just a sales platform; I envision it as a reliable and efficient technological ecosystem.

As the sole developer, I take pride in handling every aspect of the project—from designing a visually appealing and responsive frontend to building a robust, highly secure backend. I pay close attention to the smallest details, ensuring clean, maintainable, and scalable code that can evolve over time. This journey is both challenging and exhilarating, and I’m thrilled to see the project take shape with each passing day.

Stay tuned for updates as I continue to refine and expand this project. I’d love to hear feedback or ideas from the community to help make this a truly standout product!
